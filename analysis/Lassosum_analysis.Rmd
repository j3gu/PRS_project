## Introduction

### Lassosum
#### Overview of methods:
- PGS constructed using summary statistics and a reference panel under a penalized regression framework (LASSO)
- A general method for choosing tuning parameters without validation data
- Comparable prediction accuracy using dataset with phenotype
- Faster and more accurate than LDpred


#### validation with independent dataset vs. Pseudovalidation:
- Validation: r2 = 0.053, s = 0.2 lambda = 0.00127
- Pseudovalidation: r2 = 0.145 s = 0.2 lambda = 0.00695

```{r}
