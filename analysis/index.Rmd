This is the guide page for the PRS project. Below are the links to analyses.

### **Project Goal**: 
The goal is to test a few softwares to build PRSs based on GWAS summary statistics and then predict traits from genotypes from GTEx dataset.

### **Data Availability**: 
  * Base data: GWAS summary statistics (no invidual genotype data)
  * Target data: GTEx RNA-Seq individual level genotype data

### **Current GWAS**:
* Height

### QC steps:

* [QC procedures for base and target dataset](Follow_guidlines.html)

### LDPred

* [Results using LDPred](LDPred_analysis.html)

### Lassosum 

* [Results using Lassosum](Lassosum_analysis.html)
