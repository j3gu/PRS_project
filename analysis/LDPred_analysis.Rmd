### Available softwares:

1. LDPred: <https://github.com/bvilhjal/ldpred>

### LDPred
#### Overview of methods:
  - approximate Bayesian method
  - Use posterior mean to estimate mean causal effect size from GWAS summary statistics 
  * Input parameters:
       - LD radius: number of SNPs that we adjust on each side of a given sNP
            Recommendation: M/3OOO => 2 Mb LD window size in average
       - The fraction of causal markers (similar as p value threshold) [11 sets of SNP weights]
            Optimized using independent validation data
  
#### Weakness:
  - Problems of nonconvergence
  - Seem to require phenotype data to optimize hyperparameters
  
#### R-squared for logistic regression:
  - Nagelkerke R2 (not implemented in LDPred)
